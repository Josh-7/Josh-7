Hello, my name is Josh Huang and I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas. In addition to my degree, I have been increasingly passionate about finding ways to expand my skillset through online resources. As of now, I am in the process of enhancing my knowledge in the tools of Excel, SQL, and R. Beyond these technical skills, I want to emphasize my ability to translate my analysis into a comprehensible presentation for my audience. This portfolio will serve as a channel for me to upload the projects that I have been working on during this learning process.
